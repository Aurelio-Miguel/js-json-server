# js-json-server
Using JSON Server to practice making requests to an API.

The goal was to build an application that displays video information on the screen. In this application, it's also possible to add new videos and use search filters.

In this project, I used JSON Server to create an API in order to work with GET and POST requests.
The project's design and scope were provided by the Alura programming school.
